# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple commit-reveal rock paper scissors game written in Cairo1.0 for StarkNet.

### Requirements

The contract should be compiled with `cairo-lang-starknet 1.0.0-alpha.6` which can be found [here](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.6).

### Testing

To run the tests for this contract, you should run `cairo-test --starknet --path .` in the git root directory (the directory which has `cairo-project.toml`).
